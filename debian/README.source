Because Debian Stretch does not have a complete Rust packaging
environment yet, we build the Debian package by first using "cargo
vendor" to downlooad the dependencies. To run this automatically and set
things up, manually run

    debian/rules vendor

in an environment with internet accesss.

You can commit the resulting changes to your local clone, if you build
packages in CI from git sources, or you can build a source package. (You
may want to first run "debian/rules build clean" to trigger a small
change to Cargo.toml, too.) The resulting git repo / source package will
build like an ordinary Debian package, without needing to access the
internet.

The "debian/rules vendor" target does the following:
 - Runs "cargo vendor" and sets up Cargo configuration
 - Works around an issue where the current version of rustc in
   Stretch/Buster fails to compile the latest version of the "systemd"
   crate
 - Works around an issue where the "syn" crate includes a .gitignore
   file, which is automatically ignored by dpkg-source when building the
   source package
