Description: Name service non-caching daemon
 nsncd implements the NSCD (name-service caching daemon) protocol to
 provide out-of-process NSS lookups but does not implement caching.
 .
 It is designed to provide high-performance NSS lookups for programs
 that are not using the system libc, while providing semantics as if
 NSCD were not being used.
