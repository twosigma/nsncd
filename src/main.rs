//! `nsncd` is a nscd-compatible daemon that proxies lookups, without caching.
//!
//! `nsncd` stands for "Name Service Non-Caching Daemon."
//!
//! `nsncd` can be used in situations where you want to make an application use
//! nss plugins available to a different libc than the one the application will
//! load. Since most (all?) libc implementations will try to use
//! `/var/run/nscd/socket` if it exists, you can make all lookups on a machine
//! attempt to use the libc that nsncd is running with (and any nss plugins
//! available to it), regardless of the libc used by a particular application.
//!
//! `nsncd` currently does all its lookups directly in its own process, handling
//! each request on a thread. If you have `nss` plugins that behave badly (leak
//! resources, are not thread safe, etc.), this may cause problems.
//!
//! The `unscd` project attempts to solve this by handling lookup requests in
//! child processes instead of directly in the long-lived daemon. This isolates
//! the daemon from problems in the children doing the lookups, but the extra
//! overhead of forking additional child processes seems large. `unscd` can get
//! away with that because it's also caching, but we're not caching right now.
//! We might try forking child processes to handle requests at some point later.

// TODO:
// - implement other pw and group methods?
// - error handling
// - logging
// - maybe do serde better?
// - test errors in underlying calls
// - daemon/pidfile stuff
